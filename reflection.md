# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?
- idk

## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Yes, I have a fully playable game and I am very satisfied with the results.

## The hardest part?
- idk

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- There was nothing that I tried to program but couldn't figure out.
- I didn't give up on anything I had already started.
- There were some ideas such as generating different room shapes, but I realized early on that it would be too ambitious and did not attempt.
