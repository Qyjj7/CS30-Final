# Major Project Proposal

## Description

- a hack n' slash roguelike dungeon crawler

## Needs To Have

- a procedurally generated dungeon divided into rooms
- levels large enough to be explored that don't fit entirely in screen
- real time combat
- progressively more difficult dungeon levels
- sound effects
- music
- basic enemy movement in a straight line

## Nice To Have

- dynamic lighting
- improved enemy AI / pathfinding
- satisying screenshake
- decent looking graphics
- updated and more interesting generated room shapes
- multiple unique weapons and enemies
