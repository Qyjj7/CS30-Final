# Major Project Proposal

## Description

- a hack n' slash roguelike dungeon crawler

## Needs To Have

- a procedurally generated dungeon divided into rooms
- levels large enough to be explored that don't fit entirely in screen
- fluid, fast paced combat
- progressively more difficult dungeon levels
- sound effects

## Nice To Have

- dynamic lighting
- enemy AI / pathfinding
- satisying screenshake
- decent looking graphics
- music
- updated and more interesting generated room shapes
