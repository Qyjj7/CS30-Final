# Beta-Testing

## Non-programmer's advice:
- characters look weird
- very fun
- add abilities to make each weapon feel more unique
- the weapon should be displayed in the character's hands
- make it easier to regain health
- game is too difficult
- make weapon drops more common

## Programmer's advice:
- add more knockback, player is defenceless when surrounded by enemies in a corner
- sometimes enemies spawn on doors, so entering rooms can cause immediate damage
- differences between each level could be more noticeable
- weapons drop rates should be increased
- bug: weapons still gravitating towards you will disappear when you enter a new room

## My known bugs:
- ranged enemies in the top row of cells in the room cannot attack because their projectiles collide with seemingly nothing the moment they fire
- pots spawn on top of doors, stairs, and each other
- after some time of playing, the audio has a chance to start to sounding weird and glitchy (not a problem with the audio file, maybe performance issue?)
- audio starts upon first mouse press, rather than setup
